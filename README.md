Hello yellow <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="20px">

I'm Toms Stašulāns

I started to learn coding in 2021 with TypeScript. This was beggining of me understanding basics of programming world. Till now I have attended in two hardcore curses CODELEX and MC ALFA.

I have worked with:
Git;
C#;
.NET;
Relational Databses & SQL;
HTTP & Web API Basics;
Unit Testing;
Test Driven Development;
Clean Code, SOLID;
Design Patterns;
HTML & CSS, VueJS, TypeScript & NodeJS basics;

My recent projects:
sql_movies. In this project I had a good time writing those long queries which turned out to be pritty fun 😎

Flight_planner. It was a new thing at the time which took me a lot of time to research and at the end get it done 😹

Scooter_company. This was the most interesting project which seemed most meaningful for me because I think there will be much more things to rent in future. 🦾

😲 Fun fact: I am probably going to win you in a fencing bout <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-12/256/person-fencing.png" width="20px">

Looking forward to learn more, gain experience and make useful things work.
