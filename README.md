Relational Databses & SQL;
HTTP & Web API Basics;
Unit Testing;
Test Driven Development;
Clean Code, SOLID;
Design Patterns;
HTML & CSS, Angular, TypeScript & NodeJS basics;

My recent projects:
sql_movies. In this project I had a good time writing those long queries which turned out to be pretty fun 😎

Flight_planner. It was a new thing at the time which took me a lot of time to research and at the end get it done 😹

06-2021 C# Syllabus. All the basics of C# you need. I got them in this project 😎

Scooter_company. In progress 🦾

Fun fact: I am probably going to win you in a fencing bout <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-12/256/person-fencing.png" width="20px">
